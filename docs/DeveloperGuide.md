### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` while he is on the Contacts tab.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

> :exclamation: Note: In the diagram, XYZ is a placeholder for the different classes. The values of XYZ are `CustomGoal, ` `Schedule`, `Todo`, and `Person`.



The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Todo`, `CustomGoal` etc. objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in 2 `Command` objects (the first is a `TabCommand` object, the second object is from a subclass of `Command` e.g., `AddCommand`) which are both executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The first (`TabCommand`) is used to change to the tabs the user wishes to execute their command on.
4. The second command then communicates with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
5. The result of each of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("/dashboardTab /contacts delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `TabCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="900"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data, which consists of:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
  * all `Todo` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTodoList` object)
  * all `CustomGoal` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomGoalList` object)
  * all `Schedule` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueScheduleList` object)
  * for the sake of brevity, let's call such objects that are used to store data (`Todo`, `Person`, `CustomGoal`, `Schedule`) `DATA` objects
* stores the currently 'selected' `DATA` objects (for example, the results of a search query or filter command) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<DATA>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** More detailed models of each DATA object are given below.  

`Person` objects:  
<img src="images/PersonModelClassDiagram.png"/>  

`Schedule`, `Todo`, `CustomGoal` objects:
<img src="images/ScheduleTodoGoalModelClassDiagram.png"/>  

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.



### Client Analytics

#### Implementation

The `ModelManager` will create a new `ClientAnalytics` object and pass in the `AddressBook` in the `ModelManager`
as an argument. The `ClientAnalytics` object will then attach a listener to the `UniquePersonList` (which it will access via the `AddressBook` that was passed in) that corresponds to
the list of all entries in the contacts book. The `ClientAnalytics` object has an internal `TrackedValueList` which is essentially a 
wrapper class for the `ObservableList<Integer>` that contains the counts of each `Status`.

Subsequently, on the front-end, an `AnalyticsPanel` is created, which essentially just depicts (on the front end side) a simple headings-values table with the various `Status` as the headings
and the counts of the number `Person`s that have the corresponding `Status` as the values. The `AnalyticsPanel` calls the `getValues()` method of the
`AddressBook`'s `ClientAnalytics` to obtain the internal `ObservableList<Integer>` that tracks the counts of each status. The `AnalyticsPanel`
then attaches a listener to this `ObservableList<Integer>`.

Upon any change to the list of `Person`s (new person added, existing person edited, existing person deleted), the `ClientAnalytics#updateAnalytics()` method
will be automatically called (because of the listener). The update essentially involves parsing the entire list of contacts again and
recounting the values for each status. The new values are then updated in the `ClientAnalytics`'s `TrackedValueList`'s own `ObservableList<Integer>`, 
which is listened to by the `AnalyticsPanel`. Because of this listening, any change will cause the `AnalyticsPanel#updateValues()` method to be called,
which retrieves the counts of each status using the `ClientAnalytics#getValueOfTrackedField()` method. This method essentially gets the `ClientAnalytics`
to retrieve the count of a particular given `Status` and return it to the `AnalyticsPanel` to display on the dashboard to the user.

#### Design Considerations

The *observer design pattern* was heavily used here so that any update front-end update would be automatic. This is not only for consistency with the 
other sections like the `ToDo`s, `Person`s, and `Event`s, it also ensured that every update to any status in the client list was updated and displayed
immediately on the dashboard. This also reduced the need for classes relying on other classes telling them to update the values before they do so.

Updating the values was also designed to be re-counting instead of manually checking what has changed and then just making the necessary changes to the few affected
`Status`(es) because it is less prone to bugs such as where the counts of the `Status` are inaccurate. If the check and change approach was adopted instead of the re-count approach the code for updating would be
a lot more complicated since now there needs to be more checks, for example, for what was the previous `Status` and what is the new `Status` in the case of edit, and
what was the `Status` of the deleted contact in the case where contacts are deleted. Thus,the decision was made to use the simpler, cleaner approach, which,
although less efficient since it runs in O(number of people in persons list) vs O(1) for the check and update approach, the time spent is negligible and hence
does not warrant the optimisation.



### Importing .ics Schedules

For student financial advisors, they might have a portal that can generate calendar files that can be imported into google calendar,
such as NUSMods. NUSMods has a download `.ics` button that generates a `.ics` file for the users. These fields can be programmatically 
added into Advyze.

The basic structure of an `.ics` file is as follows

```
BEGIN VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//NUSMods//NUSMods//EN
BEGIN VEVENT
DTSTAMP:20211027T064817Z
DTSTART:20211123T090000Z
DTEND:20211123T110000Z
SUMMARY:CS2103 Exam
...
END VEVENT
BEGIN VEVENT
...
END VEVENT
END VCALENDAR
```

For more details, look up the definition of fields of `.ics` files at [RFC2445](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html).

#### Implementation

The current implementation is a minimal version that includes the following visible fields:

- `VEVENT`
  - `DTSTART`
  - `DTEND`
  - `SUMMARY`
  - `RRULE`
- `VCALENDAR`

Each `VEVENT` will be represented as a `Schedule`, and each recurrence specified (if applicable) in `RRULE` are independent 
`Schedules` with different start and end times. The import will not be made if there are exceptions thrown in the process of 
parsing errors or fails during verification of whether the schedule has conflicts. If clashes exist, users will be prompted
with the same message as when they add a single clashing schedule. No imports will be made. This is to get the user to do manual conflict resolution, where they need to discover and deconflict clashing schedules until the import is successful.



### Convenience Commands

To not have to go to a specific tab in order to run commands for the said tab, users can add
a tab name to indicate which tab to run the command in. To give the users visual feedback, we need to switch to the tab the command was intended for afte the command is executed.

#### Implementation

To reasonably realise this, the original AB3 needs to be reconfigured to EITHER:

1. recognize it is running at a different tab, and set `tabswitch` to be true in `CommandResult`, alongside the actual `TAB_NAME` OR
2. always run `tab [TAB NAME]` as the first command, and then runs the user's command

Both of these implementations require major overhauls, but the latter requires a much smaller one, namely modifying
how to `execute` 2 commands. To achieve this, instead of returning a `Command`, return a `List<Command>` and execute all of the Commands.

However, we only need to return the last `CommandResult` as that is what the user entered. Therefore, we always assign the last `CommandResult` to 
show feedback to user.



### Filtering Persons

#### Implementation

To allow the user to filter based on any attributes of a `Person`, a `Predicate` class is created
for each attribute. The `ModelManager` manages all data, which allows us to easily filter `Person`s based
on their atrributes by passing in the correspionding `Predicate`. 

A `Predicate` takes in a keyword, which is then used to filter the models.
Some examples are: `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`, .. etc

#### Design Considerations
Since the architecture follows a Model-view-controller design pattern, we have `FilteredList<Person>` wrapping an `ObservableList<Person>` which is used to store in-memory data of `Person` objects. Our Ui constantly listens for changes triggered by `FilterCommand#execute` which updates the `FilteredList<Person>` with a new predicate which then reflects displays the list of filtered persons on the Ui. This design provides a clean way for us to filter data using `Predicate`s.



### Adding Events //TODO

#### Implementation

The proposed feature of scheduling is parsed by `AddScheduleCommandParser`, and executed by the `AddScheduleCommand`, where it will add the new Event into the list of Events in the users schedule. While adding a new `Event` into the `Schedule`, it will help to check if the given `Event` clashes with the Events which are already in the `Schedule`. 

On top of that, `Schedule` will all be arranged in chronological order with the aid of the `Comparator<Schedule>` which is declared in `UniqueScheduleList`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How add schedule executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice) Add Schedule into one UnqiueScheduleList**
    * Pros: All the schedules are added into one list, which makes it easier to navigate. It also makes the code look cleaner and more understandable. This is also consistent with the other data classes which also use an underlying list implementation.
    * Cons: Any iteration will always be O(n) since sorting and checking if there are clashes in `Schedule` happens in this `UniqueScheduleList`
* **Alternative 2 use HashMap<Date, ScheduleList>**
    * Pros: Operation does not need to take O(n) time when it comes to checking if the `Event` clashes, since we only check if there are clashes on that particular given date.
    * Cons: Decreases overall code consistency.

&nbsp;

### Finding and Editing existing Events //TODO

#### Implementation

The proposed feature of finding and editing existing `Events` is parsed by `FindScheduleCommandParser` and `EditScheduleCommandParser` respectively. Once parsed, those command will be executed by the `FindScheduleCommand` and `EditScheduleCommand` respectively. 

For `FindScheduleCommand` a `Predicate` takes in keyword that are given by the user. Then it will search through the `UniqueScheduleList`, checking if there are any `Events` which have those keywords in the description. Once done, it will return a `List` of all the `Events` which have the same keywords as the one given by the user to be shown on the Ui.

For `EditScheduleCommand` the user will need to input the index of the `Event` to be edited, along with specifying the fields which the user would like to edit and the new information to edit to. Once completed, the old `Event` will be replaced with the new `Event` with the updated information.



### Adding Tags to Events //TODO

Tags can be added to new or existing events in the schedule so as to categorise different `Events` and allow the user to easily `Fitler` out `Events`  with the same tags.

**How tagging is implemented:**

 * In each `Event`, there is a `List<Tag>` which carries all the `Tag`s which the user has added for the `Event`. All the `Tags` which are present in this `List<Tag>` will be displayed in the user interface. 



### Filtering Events //TODO

The implementation for filtering  `Event`s is similar to finding an `Event`. The command is first parsed by the `FilterScheduleCommandParser` and then executed by the `FilterScheduleCommand`. The parser will utilise a `Predicate` to filter the `UniqueScheduleList` based on any attribute which the user specifies. The `Predicate` takes in a keyword of the respective attribute, and only the `Event`s which satisfy the `Predicate` will be displayed to the user.

**Aspect on how filtering is done**
`UniqueScheduleList` is used to keep store in-memory data which wraps an `ObservableList<Schedule>`. It is then fed to the Ui to display the filtered `Event` to the user. This design provides a clean way for us to filter data using Predicate.



### Adding Recurring Events //TODO

Adding recurring `Event`s allows user to add events the recur daily, weekly or yearly. 

If there are no clashes, new `Events` will be added until the specified recur date based on the rules (weekly, yealy or monthly), otherwise none will be added.

**Aspect on how recurring of Event is done**

This is done implementing another attribute for the `Event`, which is the recurring date. If the recurring date is present, then `Event` is a recurring `Event` otherwise it need not recur. Another attribute called `recurType` will determine if it recurs daily (D), weekly (W) or yearly (Y). `Event` will recur until it reaches the recur date.



### Viewing only past or future Events //TODO

In the event when user only want to look at he past Events, user will be able to do so using the command line `showpast`. This command line helps to retrieve only those Events which have already in the past (comparing to today's date). 

For future Events, user is able to key in the command line `showupcoming`. This command line will help user to filter out and display those Events which are upcoming. All dates here are compared to the current date.

**Aspect on how viewing only past Events is done**

Both `showpast` and `showupcoming` is done by passing down a `Predicate` into a function which is available in `Model`. This function `Model#updateFilteredScheduleList()` will then filter out and show all the events which satisfies the `Predicate` given. In the event when `Predicate` is not satisfied by the Event, the Event will not be displayed.



### Marking Todos as Done

#### Implementation

Marking a `Todo` as done is implemented as a `DoneTodoCommand`, which is similar in many ways with an `EditTodoCommand`. This similarity lies in the fact that both commands alter an attribute of the `Todo` model: the `EditTodoCommand` alters the description attribute of the `Todo`, while the `DoneTodoCommand` alters the `isDone` attribute of the `Todo`.

Since `Todos` are guaranteed to be immutable in the current implementation of the `Todo` model, the `DoneTodoCommand` applied to a `Todo` will not edit the `Todo`. Instead, a new `Todo` will be created with the same `description` but with the `isDone` attribute toggled to `true`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How mark as done executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replaces the current `Todo` with a new instance of `Todo`.
    * Pros: Consistent with the current implementation of the commands for editing a model, and thus increases consistency across the entire codebase.
    * Cons: May take up more computational resources since a new `Todo` is created every time it is marked as done. Nevertheless, the impact of this implementation on memory space is expected to be negligible, given that Java's garbage collection mechanism will automatically remove the de-referenced Todo.
* **Alternative 2:** Edits the current instance of `Todo`.
    * Pros: Might be faster and less wasteful, since there is no need to create a new `Todo` instance.
    * Cons: Decreased consistency across the codebase, and no longer guarantees that `Todo`s are immutable.



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command while he is on the Contacts tab to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` while he is on the Contacts tab to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list` while he is on the Contacts tab. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
