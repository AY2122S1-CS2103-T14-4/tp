# Advyze
This is **a project by Software Engineering (SE) students** which is designed for tech-savvy student or financial advisors who prefer CLI over GUI, and have a lot of clients and a busy school schedule to keep track of.<br>
## Example usages:
  * Keep track and manage client details
  * Keep track of all their tasks in a Todo List
  * Keep track of Scheduled Events like meetings and lessons
  * Manage priorities
  * Monitor individual goals and KPIs

## About
The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Advyze_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * Do take a look at [this](docs/AboutUs.md) if you want to know more about us individually.
